Medical Clinic Procedure:

Step 1: First you need to find your (medical or dental) form in the drawer.

 
***If this is your fist visit to the clinic, the student assistant or the nurse will give you a form to be filled out. ***

Step 2: The nurse will ask you about your medical problem and will write it down on the form, then you will be instructed to queue up for the doctor on-duty.

 
Step 3: Inside the doctor's room, the doctor will ask for your form and will start to evaluate your condition and health for your medical problem stated on the form.

 
Step 4: After the check-up, the doctor will give you the appropriate medication or treatment based on the findings.

***If the medicine that the doctor prescribed to you is available in the clinic, then they will give you your medicine for free.***
***If more medical evaluation will be needed the doctor will give a slip that will allow you to take further examination either from outside hospitals and clinics or for a follow up check-up.***

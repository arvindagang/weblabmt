FOODS FOR HAVING A HEALTHY TEETH

• Cheese

      -	Eating cheese raised the pH in the subjects' mouths and lowered their risk of tooth decay.
	It's thought that the chewing required to eat cheese increases saliva in the mouth. Cheese also contains calcium and protein,
	nutrients that strengthen tooth enamel.

• Yogurt
      - Yogurt has high in calcium and protein, which makes it a good pick for the strength and health of your teeth. 
	The probiotics, or beneficial bacteria, found in yogurt also benefit your gums because the good bacteria crowd out bacteria 
	that cause cavities. If you decide to add more yogurt to your diet, choose a plain variety with no added sugar.

• Leafy Greens
      - They're full of vitamins and minerals while being low in calories. Leafy greens such as kale and spinach also promote oral health. 
	They're high in calcium, which builds your teeth's enamel. They also contain folic acid, a type of B vitamin that has numerous
	health benefits, including possibly treating gum disease in pregnant women, according to MedlinePlus. If you have trouble getting 
	leafy greens into your diet, add a handful of baby spinach to your next salad or throw some kale on a pizza. You can also try 
	adding some greens to a smoothie.
• Apples
      - Apple is also high in fiber and water. The action of eating an apple produces saliva in your mouth, which rinses away bacteria and food particles.
	The fibrous texture of the fruit also stimulates the gums. Eating an apple isn't the same as brushing your teeth with a toothpaste that
	contains fluoride, such as Colgate® Total®, but it can tide you over until you have a chance to brush. 

• Carrots
      - Carrots are crunchy and full of fiber. Eating a handful of raw carrots at the end of the meal increases saliva production in your mouth, 
	which reduces your risk of cavities. Along with being high in fiber, carrots are a great source of vitamin A.

• Celery
      - Celery might get a bad reputation for being bland, watery and full of those pesky strings, but like carrots and apples, it acts a 
	bit like a toothbrush, scraping food particles and bacteria away from your teeth. It's also a good source of vitamins A and C, two 
	antioxidants that give the health of your gums a boost. 

• Almonds
      - Almonds are great for your teeth because they are a good source of calcium and protein while being low in sugar. 

• Water 
      - helps wash away food debris and keeps your saliva levels high. It contains proteins and minerals that counteract enamel–eating acids.
